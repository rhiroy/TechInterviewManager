  We use 'assert' to write tests that make sure our functions, given certain inputs, return the expected value.

  Using test driven development is beneficial for several reasons:

  1. It forces us to think clearly about the behavior of our function
  2. It forces us to write code in small chunks, which reduces debugging time
