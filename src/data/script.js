1. Please think out loud as you work (within reason). You’ll be given bonus points for being articulate about your thinking, especially when you are unsure of how to proceed.  I’m very interested in hearing you articulate how the computer will understand your code before you run the code.

2. If you don't know how to do something, or if you’re not sure about your code, try reasoning aloud or using console.log.  You can also use Google, just let me know first.  

3. If you’re really stuck, you can ask me questions. It counts against you somewhat, but it’s much better than just being stuck. Got it?`,
